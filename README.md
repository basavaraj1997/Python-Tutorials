The code imports necessary libraries: re for regular expressions, docx for Word document processing, BytesIO for handling binary data, Image from PIL for image manipulation, and pytesseract for OCR.
Sets the path to the Tesseract OCR executable using pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd.
Defines a function extract_text_from_word_document that takes a Word document path as input and extracts text content, including text from embedded images.
Iterates through paragraphs in the document and processes runs to accumulate text content.
Identifies embedded images by analyzing XML elements and uses Tesseract OCR to extract text from images.
The extracted text is stored in a list (text_content).
The main block specifies the document path, calls the extraction function, and prints the extracted text for each page.

1. The code imports necessary libraries: `re` for regular expressions, `docx` for Word document processing, `BytesIO` for handling binary data, `Image` from PIL for image manipulation, and `pytesseract` for OCR.
2. Sets the path to the Tesseract OCR executable using `pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd`.
3. Defines a function `extract_text_from_word_document` that takes a Word document path as input and extracts text content, including text from embedded images.
4. Iterates through paragraphs in the document and processes runs to accumulate text content.
5. Identifies embedded images by analyzing XML elements and uses Tesseract OCR to extract text from images.
6. The extracted text is stored in a list (`text_content`).
7. The main block specifies the document path, calls the extraction function, and prints the extracted text for each page.
